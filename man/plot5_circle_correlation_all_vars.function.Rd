\usage{
plot5_circle_correlation_all_vars.function(
  name,
  catVarName,
  nameExperiment,
  margin,
  nrowLegend,
  nameModel
)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{name for the plot or specific to the session}

\item{catVarName}{Column name of the qualitative
variable or categorical variable that is your dependant
variable, the one for which one you want to identify the most discriminative variables}

\item{nameExperiment}{The name of the experiment together with the number of variables we included.
if is all model, allthe variables. Instead if is the selected model is less variables.
ex:
\enumerate{
\item nameExperiment <- paste0(name,"_", length(colnames(phenoSocial_4analysis)), " variables"); #all variables
\item nameExperiment <- paste0(name,"_", length(colnames(phenoAll_4analysis_woHighCor_sel1)), " variables"); Â· without highly correlated
\item nameExperiment <- paste0(name,"_", " more informative variables ",length(colnames(parameters_more_30perc_informative_Genotype)) ) #selected variables
}}

\item{margin}{maargin to add to the x and y axis to fit properly the plots limits}

\item{nrowLegend}{Number of rows the legend should be split to, to format properly for publications.}

\item{nameModel}{Short naming for the model you are using.
Ex: "fullMdl" for the model including all variables;"Sel1" for the model not including the
highly correlated variables, "Sel30" for the model including only the variables contributing
more thana 30\%}

\value{
The plot 5 is generated in the plot5 folder in three different kind of organizations
to select the better for publications (landscape, vertical, 1 plot alone or all plots together.
